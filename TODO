Besides the TODOs listed in comments:

- To allow for short-circuiting, 'and and 'or need to be specials.
- Fix bug where interpreter disregards nil literals.
  (Use lemma/del to set variables to nil as a workaround for that
   case. Seqs with holes are still not possible...).
- (auto?) gensym
- destructuring
- multimethods
- protocols
- LemmaDoc
- Better error handling

Future:
- Self-hosting compiler!
